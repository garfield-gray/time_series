# time_series
starting this repo, it was supposed to be for armin, but due to to the obvious reasons=) he gave the project to someone else,


	and it was mostly about causality in time series especially "Granger".
	
but thanks god, I took a ML course in spring 2022s semister with Dr kamandi which was mostly Data science=)
and one of the chaps was about time series!
& today I was finishing last steps I said: why shouldn't I just put it up =)

so help me god
Amen
